# Creating Presentations with [Marpit Markdown](https://marpit.marp.app/) and [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) using OpenAI's [chatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/)

### Marpit Markdown is a markdown-based slide presentation framework, which can be used to create beautiful and interactive presentations. In this guide, we will show you how to use Marpit Markdown with TailwindCSS, which is a popular utility-first CSS framework, to create stunning presentations using OpenAI's chatGPT.

<br />

## Prerequisites

- You should have a basic understanding of markdown and CSS.
- You should have a basic understanding of how to use OpenAI's chatGPT.
- You should have a basic understanding of how to use [Marp for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=marp-team.marp-vscode) to preview Marpit Markdown presentations.
- You should have a basic understanding of how to use [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs) to style HTML elements.

## Step 1: Start with a basic Marpit Markdown structure

Start by creating a new markdown file with the following structure:

```yaml
---
marp: true
theme: uncover # or any other theme default | uncover | gaia
paginate: true
size: 16:9 # or 4:3
class: invert # for dark theme
---
# Your Presentation Title
---
## Your first slide

Add your content here.
---
## Your second slide

Add your content here.

<!-- And so on... -->
```

## Step 2: Add TailwindCSS

To add TailwindCSS to your presentation, you need to add the following line of code at the top of your markdown file:

```yaml
style: @import url('https://unpkg.com/tailwindcss@^2/dist/utilities.min.css'); # you can also use any custom CSS file
```

<br />

## Step 3: Use chatGPT to generate content

<br />

## Step 4: Use the generated content in your presentation

You can now use the generated content in your presentation by adding the result to your markdown file

<br />

## Step 5: Preview the presentation

You can preview the presentation by using a markdown viewer or by converting it to HTML. In VS Code, you can use the Marp for VS Code extension to preview the presentation.

In the marp commands, you can export the presentation to HTML, PDF, or PPTX.
